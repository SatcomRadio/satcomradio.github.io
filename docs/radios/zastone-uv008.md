There are 3 versions of this radio. The only version that works with satcom without messing with software is v3 and as 
long as you don't buy a used model you should recieve the v3 version if it was build after 2023.

It has a power of around 10W in the satcom frequencies.
The only limitations are the firmware and cps that have some limtations.

To transmit in DMR you need to have the TX on the VFO A and the RX on VFO B (or the inverse) as the firmware doesn't accept offsets when  using DMR
