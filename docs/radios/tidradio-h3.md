This transciever allows to work with satcom **without hardware modifications, only firmware**.  
Depending on the firmware you can get around 6-8W.  

To make it work you have to update the software with the IAP .exe that you can download [here](https://satcomradio.github.io/_files/TD-H3_IAP.zip). 

You can either use the R3 firmware that you can get on the [official github page](https://github.com/yobabyte/tid_umod/releases) [mirror](https://satcomradio.github.io/_files/uMod_R3.bin)  
or alternatively, use the R2 firmware that will give you 2W more of power and you can download it [here](https://satcomradio.github.io/_files/uMod_R2b.bin)

The steps are the following:
1. Turn off the radio
2. Open the software TD-H3_IAP
3. Select the firmware .bin that you want to load
4. Select the port
5. Press the START button
6. Turn on the radio while pressing the PTT button

It should now appear a progress bar at the bottom and the firmware should be loaded.  
You can use the standard CPS of TidRadio to load channels

7: Once uploaded activate the TX in menu: 52,53,54

8: On the main radio screen, hold button 7 and enter the "secret menu" 
9. Put the VHF/UHF Filter to "280 Mhz"
