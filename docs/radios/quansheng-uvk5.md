# Quansheng UV-k5

The UV-k5 (and UV-k5(8)/UV-k6) don't have much power at Satcom frequencies (1.4W).  

There are many options to increase the output power of the radio around the forums and telegram channels.  
In this website we will do one of the simplest modifications and it will give us 3-4W of output power.

1. Expand the turns in the coil marked with a "1" in the photo

2. Remove the capacitor "2" and replace it with a 6 turn coil of 0.3mm enameled wire with 1.5mm diameter (You can use a drill bit to coil the wire around it).

Its also recommended to install custom firmwares like the Matoz one to improve reception.
