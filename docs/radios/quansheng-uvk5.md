The UV-k5 (and UV-k5(8)/UV-k6) don't have much power at Satcom frequencies (1.4W).  

To increase the output power of the radio it's recommended to do the following modification:

It's essential to use a directive antenna like a yagi or an [amplifier](/amplifiers/index.md) due to the low output power.
