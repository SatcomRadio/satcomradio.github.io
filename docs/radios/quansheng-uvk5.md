# Quansheng UV-k5

The UV-k5 (and UV-k5(8)/UV-k6) don't have much power at Satcom frequencies (1.4W).  

There are many options to increase the output power of the radio around the forums and telegram channels.  
In this website we will do one of the simplest modifications and it will give us 3-4W of output power and better sensitivity.

1. Expand the turns in the coil marked with in the photo

2. Remove the capacitors shown in the picture and replace them with 4 turn coils of 0.3mm enameled wire with 1.5mm diameter (You can use a drill bit to coil the wire around it).

Its also recommended to install custom firmwares like the Matoz one to improve reception.

There's a more complex mod that involves changing several components but it allows you to get 5W output power [here](https://t.me/uv_k5_8/5/933) and [here](https://t.me/uv_k5_8/5/952)
