# Web SDR

There are some sites that allow you to recieve satcom frequencies through internet.  
Pirates use them to check if they reach the satellite or they use them to hear the transmissions if their antenna is "deaf"

Bear in mind that depending on where the SDR is located they will hear only the satellites that are reachable
