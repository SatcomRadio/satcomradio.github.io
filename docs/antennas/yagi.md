# Yagi antenna

It doesn't make sense to describe how a yagi antenna is made since there's a lot of literature about them around internet.
Just be aware that they are directional compared to the turnstile and as long as they are pointed to the satellite, they will recieve better.
  
If you want to implement circular polarization and make them cross-yagi, be sure to check the relevent [article](/polarization.md)

Here you have some of the most common designs used for Satcom. The more elements they have, the better they will work.

If you want to use a square boom of 20x20mm and 8 mm bars as elements, you can use the following 3d printed stl:
