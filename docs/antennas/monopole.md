# Monopole antenna

This antenna is probably the worst in terms of reception but it still can reach the satellite without issues and it's very portable

Simply cut 30cm of a RG213 cable and solder the central core to the connector. After that, leave 1,5cm of wire at the top.  
Do the final adjustments with NanoVNA and cut the cable until it reaches the frequency you want and always leave 1,5cm of cable exposed at the tip.
