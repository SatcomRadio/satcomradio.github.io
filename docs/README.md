## Radios

In the radio section you will find radios that work with satcom without complex modifications.  
It's **not** a full list of radios. There are many mods for other radios such as Satcom M7, TYT 9000D 
but the modifications are more complex and it's easier to stick to the radios listed in this website.

## Transverter

A [transverter](/transverters/index.md) might be the best way of stablish a connection with Satcom and reuse an existing VHF/UHF radio with a good power output.

## Frequencies

Check out the [frequencies](/freq.md) you can listen to either with your radio or with a [online SDR](/sdr.md)
